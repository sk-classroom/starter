      "llm_answer": "An Euler path is a walk through a graph that visits every edge exactly once and returns to the starting node. It\u2019s a specific type of walk that satisfies a particular condition regarding the connectivity of the graph. Euler\u2019s path theorem states that an Euler path exists if and only if the graph is connected and either all nodes have an even degree (forming an Euler circuit \u2013 a closed Euler path) or exactly two nodes have an odd degree (forming an Euler path that doesn\u2019t return to the starting point).\n\nThe K\u00f6nigsberg bridge problem exemplifies this concept. The original puzzle sought a path that crossed each of the seven bridges exactly once and returned to the starting point. Euler\u2019s analysis revealed that this was impossible because each of the four landmasses had an odd number of bridges connected to it.\n\nIn the context of large-scale networks, using sparse matrix representations like CSR or CSC is crucial because real-world networks are typically very sparse \u2013 meaning most nodes are not directly connected. These formats efficiently store only the non-zero entries, dramatically reducing memory usage and computational complexity when performing network analysis operations like calculating degrees or finding neighbors.",

      "llm_answer": "An Euler circuit is a walk in a graph that visits every edge exactly once and returns to the starting node.  According to the context material, Euler\u2019s theorem states that an Euler circuit exists if and only if the graph is connected and either all nodes have an even degree or exactly two nodes have an odd degree.  The concept arose from Euler\u2019s solution to the K\u00f6nigsberg bridge problem, where he realized that the city\u2019s network could only support a circuit if the number of bridges connected to each landmass was even.  The existence of an Euler circuit is a fundamental property of certain types of graphs, and it\u2019s a key concept in network analysis.",
