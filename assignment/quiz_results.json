      "llm_answer": "An Euler path is a walk through a graph that visits every edge exactly once and returns to the starting node. It\u2019s a specific type of walk that satisfies a particular condition regarding the degree (number of connections) of the nodes in the graph.\n\nAccording to Euler\u2019s theorem, an Euler path exists if and only if the graph is connected and either all nodes have an even degree or exactly two nodes have an odd degree. Nodes with odd degree must be the start and end points of the path.\n\nEuler\u2019s solution to the K\u00f6nigsberg bridge problem demonstrated this concept. The city\u2019s bridge network had four landmasses, each connected to an odd number of bridges, making it impossible to find an Euler path.  The problem highlighted the importance of analyzing the *structure* of the network \u2013 the connections between nodes \u2013 rather than focusing on the physical properties of the elements themselves.\n\nThe concept of an Euler path is fundamental to network science and is used to analyze the connectivity and flow of information or resources within complex systems.",

According to the context material, Euler\u2019s theorem states that an Euler circuit exists if and only if either all nodes in the graph have an even degree (meaning they have an even number of connections) or exactly two nodes have an odd degree.
