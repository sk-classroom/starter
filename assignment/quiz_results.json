      "llm_answer": "An Euler path is a walk through a graph that visits every edge exactly once and returns to the starting node. It\u2019s a specific type of walk that satisfies a particular condition regarding the connectivity of the graph. Euler\u2019s path theorem states that an Euler path exists if and only if the graph is connected and either all nodes have an even degree (forming an Euler circuit \u2013 a closed Euler path) or exactly two nodes have an odd degree (forming an Euler path that doesn\u2019t return to the starting point).\n\nThe K\u00f6nigsberg bridge problem exemplifies this concept. The initial analysis of the bridges revealed that each landmass had an odd number of bridges, making it impossible to create an Euler path that crossed each bridge exactly once and returned to the starting point.  Euler\u2019s abstraction of the problem into a network of nodes and edges, focusing on node degrees, was crucial to identifying this constraint.  The story highlights how mathematical abstraction can reveal fundamental limitations in complex systems.",

Euler\u2019s theorem states that an Euler circuit exists if and only if the graph is connected and all nodes have an even degree.  The concept originated from Euler\u2019s solution to the K\u00f6nigsberg bridge problem, where he demonstrated that a path could be found that traversed each bridge exactly once and returned to the starting point, provided the graph met these conditions.  The K\u00f6nigsberg example highlighted the importance of node degree in determining the existence of such a circuit.",
