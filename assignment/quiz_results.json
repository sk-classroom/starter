      "llm_answer": "An Euler path is a walk through a graph that visits every edge exactly once and returns to the starting node.  It\u2019s a specific type of walk that satisfies a particular condition regarding the connectivity of the graph.  Euler\u2019s path theorem states that an Euler path exists if and only if the graph is connected and either all nodes have an even degree (forming an Euler circuit \u2013 a closed Euler path) or exactly two nodes have an odd degree (forming an Euler path that doesn\u2019t return to the starting point).\n\nThe K\u00f6nigsberg bridge problem exemplifies this concept. The original puzzle involved finding a walk across the seven bridges of K\u00f6nigsberg that crossed each bridge exactly once and returned to the starting point. Euler\u2019s analysis demonstrated that such a walk was impossible because every landmass in the city had an odd number of bridges connected to it.\n\nIn the context of large-scale networks, using sparse matrix representations like CSR or CSC is crucial because real-world networks are typically very sparse \u2013 meaning most nodes are not directly connected.  These formats efficiently store only the non-zero entries, dramatically reducing memory usage and computational complexity when analyzing network properties like degree or identifying neighbors.",

      "evaluation_explanation": "The student's answer is a correct and concise definition of an Euler path. The LLM's answer, while also correct in its definition, includes extraneous information about Euler circuits, Euler's path theorem, the K\u00f6nigsberg bridge problem, and sparse matrix representations, which were not asked for in the question. The prompt asks to evaluate if the LLM's answer is correct or incorrect based on the student's answer and the question. The student's answer is correct. The LLM's answer is also correct in its definition of an Euler path, but it goes beyond the scope of the question and the student's answer by including additional, unrequested information. However, the prompt states to 'Consider the answer correct if it demonstrates understanding of the core concepts, even if the wording is different from the student's answer.' The LLM demonstrates understanding of the core concept. The prompt also states to 'Consider it incorrect if there are errors, missing key points, or fundamental misunderstandings.' The LLM's answer has no errors or missing key points regarding the definition of an Euler path. Therefore, the LLM's answer is considered correct.",

      "llm_answer": "An Euler circuit is a walk in a graph that visits every edge exactly once and returns to the starting node.  According to the context material, Euler\u2019s theorem states that an Euler circuit exists if and only if the graph is connected and either all nodes have an even degree or exactly two nodes have an odd degree.  The concept arose from Euler\u2019s solution to the K\u00f6nigsberg bridge problem, where he realized that the city\u2019s network could only support such a circuit if the number of nodes with odd degree was limited to two.  This was a revolutionary abstraction \u2013 focusing on the *relationships* (connections) between nodes rather than the physical properties of the network itself.",
