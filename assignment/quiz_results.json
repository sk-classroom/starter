      "llm_answer": "An Euler path is a walk through a graph that visits every edge exactly once and returns to the starting node. It\u2019s a specific type of walk that satisfies a particular condition regarding the connectivity of the graph. Euler\u2019s path theorem states that an Euler path exists if and only if the graph is connected and either all nodes have an even degree (forming an Euler circuit \u2013 a closed Euler path) or exactly two nodes have an odd degree (forming an Euler path that doesn\u2019t return to the starting point).\n\nThe K\u00f6nigsberg bridge problem exemplifies this concept. The initial analysis of the seven bridges revealed that each landmass had an odd number of bridges, making it impossible to create an Euler path that crossed each bridge exactly once and returned to the starting point.  Euler\u2019s abstraction of the problem into a network of landmasses and bridges, focusing on node degrees, was crucial to identifying this limitation.\n\nThe concept of an Euler path is fundamental to network science, providing a way to analyze the connectivity and potential traversability of complex systems, as demonstrated by Euler\u2019s groundbreaking solution to a seemingly simple puzzle.",

      "llm_answer": "An Euler circuit is a walk in a graph that visits every edge exactly once and returns to the starting node.  According to the context material, Euler\u2019s theorem states that an Euler circuit exists if and only if the graph is connected and either all nodes have an even degree or exactly two nodes have an odd degree.  The concept arose from Euler\u2019s solution to the K\u00f6nigsberg bridge problem, where he recognized that the city\u2019s network could be represented as a graph and analyzed based on node degrees.  The existence of an Euler circuit is a crucial characteristic for certain network analysis tasks, indicating a highly connected and cyclical structure.",
