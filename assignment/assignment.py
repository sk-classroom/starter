    # Interactive Data Visualization with marimo

    Welcome to your first interactive data visualization assignment! You'll learn plotting and data exploration through hands-on experimentation with marimo's reactive notebook interface.

    # üìö Understanding marimo Notebooks

    Before diving into data visualization, let's explore marimo's unique features that make interactive computing powerful and intuitive.

    ## üîë Key Concept 1: Reactive Programming

    In marimo, when you change one thing, everything that depends on it updates automatically! No need to manually re-run cells.

    Let's see this in action with a simple example:

           color=['lightblue', 'lightcoral'])
    _ax.set_title('Reactive Updates in Action!')
    _ax.set_ylabel('Value')
    plt.tight_layout()

    mo.md(
        r"""
    **üéâ Did you see that?** When you moved the slider:
    1. The text updated automatically
    2. The plot redrawed automatically
    3. No manual clicking "Run" buttons!

    This is **reactive programming** - the core magic of marimo!

    ## üîë Key Concept 2: Variable Scoping

    In marimo's visual interface, you don't see function definitions, but behind the scenes, each cell is a function. Variables are shared between cells automatically.

    /// attention | Attention!
    Each variable name can only be defined in one cell. If you try to define the same variable in multiple cells, marimo will show you an error.
    ///


    - ‚úÖ **Good**: Each cell defines unique variables

    - ‚ùå **Bad**: Multiple cells defining `data = ...`

    **üîß Pro Tip**: Use underscore prefix for local variables that don't need to be shared:
    - `_fig, _ax = plt.subplots()` instead of `fig, ax = plt.subplots()`
    - `_temp_data = process(data)` for temporary calculations
    - `_i, _j, _k` for loop counters

    This prevents conflicts when multiple cells create plots or temporary variables!

    Example:

    - The following cell causes an error because it redefines the same variable `sample_data` in multiple cells.

    - To resolve this, you need to rename the variable name in the either cell to something else. If the variable is used only in that cell, you can use an underscore prefix, i.e., `_sample_data = ...`.

    ## üîë Key Concept 3: Order Doesn't Matter

    In traditional notebooks, cell order matters. In marimo, it doesn't! marimo automatically figures out the right execution order based on dependencies.

    **üß™ Interactive Example**: Try this - the cells below are intentionally in "wrong" order in traditional sense, but they work perfectly! This is particularly useful when you want to bring your visualization up front and then all the data loading and processing later.

    ## Task 1

    Let us learn how the grading works through the following example.
    First, there two types of cells, i.e., those that are graded and those that are not.
    We will evaluate only the cells that are marked as "\#Task".
    For almost all cases, the task is to implement a Python function.
    The Python function is accompanied by the docstring that specifies the input and output of the function.
    Your task is to implement the function and test it.

    Example:
    ```python
    #Task
    def calc_square(x):
        '''
        Calculate the square of a number.

        Args:
            x (int): The number to square.

        Returns:
            int: The square of the number.
        '''
        )
        pass
        return
    ```

    /// attention | Attention!
    Do not import any libraries inside the function. This will cause the grading to fail.
    ///

    Once you implement the function, you can test it by running the cell.
    The test will be automatically graded and the result will be shown on GitHub.

    To demonstrate how the grading works, let's implement the function.
