    "# About this assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we will learn how to submit the assignment to the GitHub Classroom.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How the grading works\n",
    "\n",
    "When you submit your code, GitHub Actions automatically runs predefined tests on your submission. These tests check if your functions work correctly by comparing their outputs with expected results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The test process is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Push your code to GitHub\n",
    "2. Tests run automatically\n",
    "3. Get immediate feedback via green ✓ or red ✗ marks \n",
    "4. View detailed test results in Actions tab\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tips\n",
    "- Run tests locally before submitting\n",
    "- Check error messages carefully\n",
    "- Commit and push after each major change\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Protected files\n",
    "\n",
    "Protected files are test files and configuration files you cannot modify. They appear in your repository but don't make any changes to them. You can change them and commit them to your repository, but any changes you make to them will be notified to the instructor for review. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Integrity \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a system that automatically checks code similarity across all submissions and online repositories. Sharing code or submitting copied work will result in zero credit and disciplinary action. While you can discuss concepts, each student must write their own code. Cite any external resources, including AI tools, in your comments. Start early and ask for help during office hours if needed. The goal is to learn through genuine effort, not shortcuts.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the following tasks and upload your notebook to your GitHub repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Fill in the blank functions, marked by, \"\\#TODO\", in the notebook\n",
    "2. Update this notebook by using `git add`, `git commit`, and then `git push`.\n",
    "3. The notebook will be automatically graded, and your score will be shown on GitHub. See [how to check the results on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/learn-with-github-classroom/view-autograding-results)\n",
    "\n",
    "Dont's:\n",
    "- Do not import any libraries except for the ones that are already imported. The grading script will not work if you import additional libraries.\n",
    "- Do not change the name of the functions. The grading script will not work if you change the name of the functions.\n",
    "- DO not remove the cells with tag \"gradable\". If you happen to remove the cells with tag \"gradable\", recreate the cell and add the tag \"gradable\" to the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do's:\n",
    "- Make the code clearn and easy to understand. Consider using linters & formatters such as `black`. [Youtube: Linters and fixers: never worry about code formatting again (Vim + Ale + Flake8 & Black for Python) by Yong-Yeol Ahn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FKPySR6HLk)\n",
    "- You can add additional cells as you like. If you want to include the additional cells in the grading, you need to add the tag \"gradable\" to the cell. Otherwise, your additional cells will be stripped out when grading. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "In the assignment, you can only use the specified libraries. You cannot import any other libraries that result in the grading script failing or a zero score. So make sure NOT to import any other libraries! For example, "
