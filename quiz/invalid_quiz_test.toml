question = "Solve the differential equation d²y/dx² + 4y = 0 using Laplace transforms and show all mathematical steps with complete derivations."
answer = "The solution is y = C₁cos(2x) + C₂sin(2x) where C₁ and C₂ are constants determined by initial conditions. The Laplace transform approach involves taking L{d²y/dx²} = s²Y(s) - sy(0) - y'(0) and solving the algebraic equation."
