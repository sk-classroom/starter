      "correct_answer": "A graph has an Euler path if and only if: (1) All nodes have even degree, OR (2) Exactly two nodes have odd degree. If all nodes have even degree, the path forms a cycle. If exactly two nodes have odd degree, the path must start at one odd-degree node and end at the other.",
      "llm_answer": "Euler's Path Theorem states the necessary and sufficient conditions for a graph to have an Euler path. An Euler path is a trail in a graph that visits every edge exactly once, but not necessarily starting and ending at the same vertex.\n\nFor an undirected graph to have an Euler path:\n1. **The number of vertices with odd degree must be exactly two**. These are the only two vertices where the path will start and end, respectively.\n2. All other vertices in the graph must have even degrees.\n\nIf these conditions are met, then a graph has an Euler path but not necessarily an Euler circuit (a closed trail that visits every edge exactly once).\n\nFor directed graphs:\n1. **Exactly one vertex should have \\((\\text{out-degree}) - (\\text{in-degree}) = 1\\) (the start of the Euler path)**\n2. Exactly one vertex should have \\((\\text{in-degree}) - (\\text{out-degree}) = 1\\) (the end of the Euler path)\n3. All other vertices must satisfy \\(\\text{in-degree} = \\text{out-degree}\\)\n\nIf these conditions are satisfied, then a directed graph has an Euler path.\n\nThese criteria ensure that the graph can be traversed in such a way that each edge is visited exactly once while allowing for the start and end points to differ if necessary.",

      "question": "In the original K\u00f6nigsberg bridge problem, why was it impossible to find a walk that crosses each bridge exactly once? Explain using the concept of node degrees.",
      "correct_answer": "It was impossible because all four landmasses (nodes) had an odd number of bridges (odd degree): North shore (3 bridges), South shore (3 bridges), Large island (5 bridges), and Small island (3 bridges). According to Euler's theorem, for an Euler path to exist, at most two nodes can have odd degree. Since all four nodes had odd degree, the desired walk was mathematically impossible.",
      "llm_answer": "The impossibility of finding a walk in the original K\u00f6nigsberg bridge problem that crosses each bridge exactly once can be explained using Eulerian paths and the concept of node degrees in graph theory. \n\nIn graph theory, an Eulerian path is a trail in a graph that visits every edge exactly once. For such a path to exist in an undirected graph (like the one representing K\u00f6nigsberg's bridges), it must have either zero or two vertices with odd degrees (nodes connected by an odd number of edges). If there are no nodes with odd degrees, then an Eulerian circuit (a closed loop that visits every edge exactly once and returns to the starting point) exists. \n\nIn the original K\u00f6nigsberg problem:\n- There were four landmasses (nodes) connected by seven bridges (edges).\n- The degrees of these nodes were as follows: \n  - Two nodes had a degree of 3.\n  - Two nodes had a degree of 5.\n\nSince there are more than two nodes with odd degrees, specifically four in this case, it is impossible to find an Eulerian path. An Eulerian path requires at most two nodes to have an odd degree; having four means you cannot pair up the edges in such a way that would allow for each bridge to be crossed exactly once without repeating any edge or leaving some bridges unused.\n\nTherefore, based on the degrees of the nodes, it is impossible to construct a walk that crosses each bridge exactly once.",

      "question": "Given an adjacency matrix A for an undirected graph, how would you compute the degree of each node? What mathematical property ensures that the sum of all degrees equals twice the number of edges?",
      "correct_answer": "The degree of each node is computed by summing the rows (or columns) of the adjacency matrix: degree[i] = sum(A[i,:]). The sum of all degrees equals twice the number of edges because each edge contributes 1 to the degree of both of its endpoints. If there are m edges, then sum of all degrees = 2m, since each edge is counted once for each of its two endpoints.",
      "llm_answer": "To compute the degree of each node in an undirected graph using its adjacency matrix \\( A \\), you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Adjacency Matrix Definition**: The adjacency matrix \\( A \\) is a square matrix where \\( A[i][j] = 1 \\) if there is an edge between nodes \\( i \\) and \\( j \\), and \\( A[i][j] = 0 \\) otherwise.\n\n2. **Degree Calculation**:\n   - For each node \\( i \\), compute the degree by summing up all entries in the \\( i \\)-th row (or equivalently, the \\( i \\)-th column, since the graph is undirected and thus the matrix is symmetric).\n   - Mathematically, the degree of node \\( i \\) is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Degree}(i) = \\sum_{j} A[i][j]\n     \\]\n\n3. **Ensuring Symmetry**: Since the graph is undirected, \\( A \\) is symmetric (\\( A[i][j] = A[j][i] \\)). This symmetry ensures that counting edges by row or column yields consistent results.\n\nThe mathematical property ensuring that the sum of all degrees equals twice the number of edges is based on how edges are counted in an adjacency matrix:\n\n- Each edge \\( (i, j) \\) contributes to the degree of both nodes \\( i \\) and \\( j \\).\n- Thus, each edge appears twice in the total sum of the degrees: once in the row for node \\( i \\) and once in the column for node \\( j \\).\n\nIf there are \\( E \\) edges in the graph:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{i} \\text{Degree}(i) = 2E\n\\]\n\nThis is known as the Handshaking Lemma, which states that the sum of all vertex degrees in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges.",
