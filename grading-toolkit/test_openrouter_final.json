      "correct_answer": "A graph has an Euler path if and only if: (1) All nodes have even degree, OR (2) Exactly two nodes have odd degree. If all nodes have even degree, the path forms a cycle. If exactly two nodes have odd degree, the path must start at one odd-degree node and end at the other.",
      "llm_answer": "According to Euler's Path Theorem, a graph has an Euler path if and only if:\n\n1. **Connectedness**: The graph is connected, meaning there is a path between any two vertices.\n2. **Degree Condition**: The graph has exactly zero or two vertices of odd degree. If there are zero vertices of odd degree, the Euler path is a circuit (starts and ends at the same vertex). If there are two vertices of odd degree, the Euler path starts at one odd-degree vertex and ends at the other.\n\nIn summary, a graph has an Euler path if it is connected and has either zero or two vertices with an odd degree.",

      "question": "In the original K\u00f6nigsberg bridge problem, why was it impossible to find a walk that crosses each bridge exactly once? Explain using the concept of node degrees.",
      "correct_answer": "It was impossible because all four landmasses (nodes) had an odd number of bridges (odd degree): North shore (3 bridges), South shore (3 bridges), Large island (5 bridges), and Small island (3 bridges). According to Euler's theorem, for an Euler path to exist, at most two nodes can have odd degree. Since all four nodes had odd degree, the desired walk was mathematically impossible.",
      "llm_answer": "In the original K\u00f6nigsberg bridge problem, it was impossible to find a walk that crosses each bridge exactly once because the graph representing the problem had four nodes (land areas) with odd degrees (each land area had an odd number of bridges connected to it).\n\nIn graph theory, for an Eulerian trail (a path that uses every edge exactly once) to exist in a graph, it must have exactly zero or two nodes of odd degree. If there are more than two nodes with odd degrees, an Eulerian trail cannot exist. In the K\u00f6nigsberg bridge problem, since there were four nodes with odd degrees, it was impossible to find such a walk. This is known as Euler's theorem on Eulerian trails.",

It correctly states the condition for an Eulerian trail (0 or 2 odd degree nodes) and applies it to the K\u00f6nigsberg problem. The explanation is clear and concise, and demonstrates a solid understanding of the underlying graph theory. It's essentially a rephrasing of the correct answer, and doesn't introduce any errors.",

      "question": "Given an adjacency matrix A for an undirected graph, how would you compute the degree of each node? What mathematical property ensures that the sum of all degrees equals twice the number of edges?",
      "correct_answer": "The degree of each node is computed by summing the rows (or columns) of the adjacency matrix: degree[i] = sum(A[i,:]). The sum of all degrees equals twice the number of edges because each edge contributes 1 to the degree of both of its endpoints. If there are m edges, then sum of all degrees = 2m, since each edge is counted once for each of its two endpoints.",
      "llm_answer": "To compute the degree of each node from an adjacency matrix \\( A \\) of an undirected graph, you can sum the entries in each row (or column, since the graph is undirected) of the matrix. Specifically, for a node \\( i \\), its degree \\( d_i \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ d_i = \\sum_{j} A_{ij} \\]\n\nThis works because each entry \\( A_{ij} \\) is 1 if there is an edge between nodes \\( i \\) and \\( j \\), and 0 otherwise. Summing over all columns for node \\( i \\) counts all edges connected to node \\( i \\).\n\nThe mathematical property that ensures the sum of all degrees equals twice the number of edges is the Handshaking Lemma. This lemma states that:\n\n\\[ \\sum_{i} d_i = 2E \\]\n\nwhere \\( E \\) is the number of edges in the graph. This is because each edge contributes to the degree of two nodes (one at each end), so the sum of all degrees counts each edge twice.",
