      "correct_answer": "A graph has an Euler path if and only if: (1) All nodes have even degree, OR (2) Exactly two nodes have odd degree. If all nodes have even degree, the path forms a cycle. If exactly two nodes have odd degree, the path must start at one odd-degree node and end at the other.",
      "llm_answer": "According to Euler's Path Theorem, the necessary and sufficient condition for a connected graph G to have an Euler path is:\n\n1. The graph must be connected.\n2. All vertices of the graph must have even degrees.\n\nThis means that if these two conditions are met, then there exists an Eulerian path (a path that traverses every edge exactly once) in the graph.",

While it correctly states the connectedness requirement and the condition for an Euler *cycle* (all even degrees), it omits the crucial alternative condition for an Euler *path* \u2013 that exactly two nodes can have odd degree.

      "question": "In the original K\u00f6nigsberg bridge problem, why was it impossible to find a walk that crosses each bridge exactly once? Explain using the concept of node degrees.",
      "correct_answer": "It was impossible because all four landmasses (nodes) had an odd number of bridges (odd degree): North shore (3 bridges), South shore (3 bridges), Large island (5 bridges), and Small island (3 bridges). According to Euler's theorem, for an Euler path to exist, at most two nodes can have odd degree. Since all four nodes had odd degree, the desired walk was mathematically impossible.",
      "llm_answer": "The original K\u00f6nigsberg bridge problem states that the city of K\u00f6nigsberg had seven bridges connecting two banks of the Pregel River. In order to solve this problem, we can use the concept of graph theory and node degrees.\n\nLet's represent the city as a planar graph with the following nodes (banks) and edges (bridges):\n\n- Node A\n- Node B\n- Node C\n- Node D\n\nEdges between nodes:\n\n- AB\n- BC\n- CD\n- DA\n- AC\n- BD\n\nIn order to find a walk that crosses each bridge exactly once, we need to start at one node and visit all edges without repeating any edge. \n\nTo analyze the possibility of such a walk, let's calculate the degree of each node:\n\n- Node A: degree = 3 (edges AB, BC, CD)\n- Node B: degree = 3 (edges AB, BC, DA)\n- Node C: degree = 2 (edge AC, CD)\n- Node D: degree = 2 (edges CD, DA)\n\nAccording to the Handshaking Lemma in graph theory, which relates the sum of node degrees to the number of edges in a connected planar graph, we have:\n\nSum of node degrees = 2 * Number of edges\n\nThe K\u00f6nigsberg problem has 7 edges. The sum of node degrees is:\n3 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 10\n\nSince 10 (sum of node degrees) > 14 (2 times the number of edges), there are not enough handshakes (edges) to allow for every node to have degree 4 (the maximum possible if each edge was traversed exactly once). This means that it is impossible to find a walk that crosses each bridge exactly once.",

        "verdict": "INCORRECT",
        "explanation": "The student correctly identifies the need to use graph theory and node degrees. However, the student makes a critical error in representing the connections between the landmasses/nodes. The provided edge list does *not* accurately represent the original K\u00f6nigsberg bridge problem. The original problem had connections like A-B, A-C, B-C, B-D, C-D, and two connections between A and D. The student\u2019s representation significantly alters the graph and therefore leads to an incorrect degree calculation and a nonsensical conclusion about the sum of degrees exceeding twice the number of edges (they incorrectly state 14 as 2 * number of edges when there are only 7 edges listed). While they mention the Handshaking Lemma, its application is flawed due to the incorrect graph representation. The correct reasoning centers on Euler's theorem which states that an Eulerian path exists if and only if zero or two nodes have odd degree. The student doesn\u2019t apply this theorem correctly, or even mention it.",

      "question": "Given an adjacency matrix A for an undirected graph, how would you compute the degree of each node? What mathematical property ensures that the sum of all degrees equals twice the number of edges?",
      "correct_answer": "The degree of each node is computed by summing the rows (or columns) of the adjacency matrix: degree[i] = sum(A[i,:]). The sum of all degrees equals twice the number of edges because each edge contributes 1 to the degree of both of its endpoints. If there are m edges, then sum of all degrees = 2m, since each edge is counted once for each of its two endpoints.",
      "llm_answer": "To compute the degree of each node in an undirected graph using its adjacency matrix A, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Transpose the adjacency matrix A to get its transpose, denoted as A^T.\n2. The diagonal elements of A^T represent the degree of each node in the original graph.\n\nHere's why this works:\n\nIn a bipartite graph (which an undirected graph is), where each edge connects two distinct nodes, each row and column in the adjacency matrix represents a node. When we transpose the matrix, the index values swap between rows and columns, but the degree of a node remains consistent.\n\nMathematically, the property that ensures the sum of all degrees equals twice the number of edges is known as Kirchhoff's first law or the Handshaking lemma in graph theory:\n\n\u2211deg(v) = 2|E|\n\nwhere:\n- \u2211deg(v) is the sum of the degrees of all nodes (i.e., the number of total \"in-degrees\" plus \"out-degrees\")\n- |E| represents the number of edges in the graph\n\nThis property holds because each edge contributes to exactly two node degrees: one as an incoming degree for its endpoint and another as an outgoing degree for the other endpoint.",
