      "correct_answer": "A graph has an Euler path if and only if: (1) All nodes have even degree, OR (2) Exactly two nodes have odd degree. If all nodes have even degree, the path forms a cycle. If exactly two nodes have odd degree, the path must start at one odd-degree node and end at the other.",
      "llm_answer": "According to Euler's Path Theorem, a connected graph has an Euler path if and only if it has exactly zero or two vertices of odd degree. Here are the necessary and sufficient conditions broken down:\n\n1. **Connectedness**: The graph must be connected, meaning there is a path between any pair of vertices in the graph.\n\n2. **Vertices of Odd Degree**:\n   - If there are exactly zero vertices with an odd degree (i.e., all vertices have even degrees), then the graph not only has an Euler path but also contains an Euler circuit (a closed Euler path that starts and ends at the same vertex).\n   - If there are exactly two vertices with an odd degree, then the graph has an Euler path starting at one of these odd-degree vertices and ending at the other.\n\nIn summary, for a graph to have an Euler path, it must be connected and have either zero or exactly two vertices with an odd degree.",

      "question": "In the original K\u00f6nigsberg bridge problem, why was it impossible to find a walk that crosses each bridge exactly once? Explain using the concept of node degrees.",
      "correct_answer": "It was impossible because all four landmasses (nodes) had an odd number of bridges (odd degree): North shore (3 bridges), South shore (3 bridges), Large island (5 bridges), and Small island (3 bridges). According to Euler's theorem, for an Euler path to exist, at most two nodes can have odd degree. Since all four nodes had odd degree, the desired walk was mathematically impossible.",
      "llm_answer": "The original K\u00f6nigsberg bridge problem is centered around finding an Eulerian path\u2014a walk through a graph that crosses each edge (bridge) exactly once. For such a path to exist, certain conditions related to the degrees of nodes (vertices), where edges meet, must be met.\n\nIn graph theory terms:\n\n1. An **Eulerian circuit** exists if and only if every vertex in the graph has an even degree.\n2. An **Eulerian path**, which does not necessarily return to the starting point but still crosses each edge once, exists if exactly zero or two vertices have an odd degree.\n\nIn the K\u00f6nigsberg bridge problem:\n\n- The graph of K\u00f6nigsberg consists of four landmasses (nodes) connected by seven bridges (edges).\n- If you count the number of bridges meeting at each landmass:\n  - Two nodes have a degree of 3.\n  - Two other nodes also have a degree of 3.\n\nThis results in all four nodes having an odd degree. Since more than two vertices have an odd degree, neither an Eulerian path nor an Eulerian circuit is possible according to the conditions specified above. Therefore, it was impossible to find a walk that crosses each bridge exactly once in K\u00f6nigsberg.",

      "question": "Given an adjacency matrix A for an undirected graph, how would you compute the degree of each node? What mathematical property ensures that the sum of all degrees equals twice the number of edges?",
      "correct_answer": "The degree of each node is computed by summing the rows (or columns) of the adjacency matrix: degree[i] = sum(A[i,:]). The sum of all degrees equals twice the number of edges because each edge contributes 1 to the degree of both of its endpoints. If there are m edges, then sum of all degrees = 2m, since each edge is counted once for each of its two endpoints.",
      "llm_answer": "To compute the degree of each node in an undirected graph using its adjacency matrix \\( A \\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Row or Column Sum**: Since the graph is undirected, \\( A \\) is symmetric (\\( a_{ij} = a_{ji} \\)). The degree of node \\( i \\) is equal to the sum of the elements in either the \\( i \\)-th row or the \\( i \\)-th column of the adjacency matrix. Mathematically, for node \\( i \\), its degree \\( d_i \\) can be calculated as:\n   \\[\n   d_i = \\sum_{j} a_{ij}\n   \\]\n   where the sum is over all nodes \\( j \\).\n\n2. **Mathematical Property**: The sum of all degrees in the graph is equal to twice the number of edges, which stems from each edge being counted twice in the degree calculation\u2014once at each endpoint. Formally:\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{i} d_i = 2E\n   \\]\n   where \\( E \\) is the total number of edges.\n\nThis property holds because each entry \\( a_{ij} \\) that equals 1 contributes to the degree count for both nodes \\( i \\) and \\( j \\). Therefore, every edge in an undirected graph contributes exactly twice to the sum of all degrees.",
