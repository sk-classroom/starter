      "correct_answer": "A graph has an Euler path if and only if: (1) All nodes have even degree, OR (2) Exactly two nodes have odd degree. If all nodes have even degree, the path forms a cycle. If exactly two nodes have odd degree, the path must start at one odd-degree node and end at the other.",
      "llm_answer": "According to Euler's Path Theorem, a connected graph has an Euler path if and only if it has exactly zero or two vertices of odd degree. Here are the necessary and sufficient conditions:\n\n1. **Connected Graph**: The graph must be connected, meaning there is a path between any pair of vertices in the graph.\n\n2. **Vertices of Odd Degree**:\n   - If there are **zero** vertices with an odd degree, then the graph has an Euler circuit (a closed walk that crosses every edge exactly once and starts and ends at the same vertex).\n   - If there are **exactly two** vertices with an odd degree, the graph has an Euler path but not an Euler circuit. The path will start at one of these odd-degree vertices and end at the other.\n\nThese conditions ensure that it is possible to traverse every edge exactly once while satisfying the constraints imposed by vertex degrees in a connected graph.",

      "question": "In the original K\u00f6nigsberg bridge problem, why was it impossible to find a walk that crosses each bridge exactly once? Explain using the concept of node degrees.",
      "correct_answer": "It was impossible because all four landmasses (nodes) had an odd number of bridges (odd degree): North shore (3 bridges), South shore (3 bridges), Large island (5 bridges), and Small island (3 bridges). According to Euler's theorem, for an Euler path to exist, at most two nodes can have odd degree. Since all four nodes had odd degree, the desired walk was mathematically impossible.",
      "llm_answer": "In the original K\u00f6nigsberg bridge problem, it is impossible to find a walk (Eulerian path) that crosses each bridge exactly once due to the configuration of the node degrees. The city of K\u00f6nigsberg was divided into four landmasses connected by seven bridges. If we model this as a graph:\n\n- Each landmass is represented as a \"node\" (vertex).\n- Each bridge is represented as an \"edge.\"\n\nFor a walk to cross each edge exactly once, the graph must have either:\n1. Exactly zero or two nodes with an odd degree (odd number of edges) for an Eulerian path (a walk that starts and ends at different vertices).\n2. All nodes must have even degrees for an Eulerian circuit (a walk that starts and ends at the same vertex).\n\nIn the K\u00f6nigsberg graph:\n- The degrees of the four nodes are 5, 3, 3, and 3.\n\nSince all four landmasses have odd degrees, it is impossible to form either an Eulerian path or an Eulerian circuit. Therefore, no walk exists that crosses each bridge exactly once.",

      "question": "Given an adjacency matrix A for an undirected graph, how would you compute the degree of each node? What mathematical property ensures that the sum of all degrees equals twice the number of edges?",
      "correct_answer": "The degree of each node is computed by summing the rows (or columns) of the adjacency matrix: degree[i] = sum(A[i,:]). The sum of all degrees equals twice the number of edges because each edge contributes 1 to the degree of both of its endpoints. If there are m edges, then sum of all degrees = 2m, since each edge is counted once for each of its two endpoints.",
      "llm_answer": "To compute the degree of each node in an undirected graph given its adjacency matrix \\( A \\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Adjacency Matrix**: In an undirected graph, the adjacency matrix \\( A \\) is symmetric, meaning \\( A[i][j] = A[j][i] \\). An element \\( A[i][j] \\) is 1 if there's an edge between nodes \\( i \\) and \\( j \\), and 0 otherwise.\n\n2. **Compute Node Degrees**: The degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it. For undirected graphs, this can be found by summing each row (or equivalently, each column due to symmetry) of the adjacency matrix:\n   - Degree of node \\( i \\), denoted as \\( d_i \\), is calculated as: \n     \\[\n     d_i = \\sum_{j} A[i][j]\n     \\]\n\n3. **Summing All Degrees**: The sum of all degrees in the graph can be found by summing all elements in any row or column (since the matrix is symmetric, it doesn't matter which one you choose):\n   - Total degree sum \\( D \\) is:\n     \\[\n     D = \\sum_{i} d_i = \\sum_{i} \\sum_{j} A[i][j]\n     \\]\n\n**Mathematical Property**: The sum of all degrees equals twice the number of edges due to each edge contributing to the degree count of two nodes (both endpoints). Therefore, if \\( E \\) is the total number of edges in the graph:\n   - Each edge \\( (i, j) \\) adds 1 to both \\( d_i \\) and \\( d_j \\).\n   - Thus, \\( D = 2E \\).\n\nThis property ensures that when you sum up all degrees from the adjacency matrix, it accounts for each edge twice\u2014once at each endpoint.",
