      "correct_answer": "When soil phosphorus is extremely high, the plant reduces its investment in mycorrhizal partnerships, leading to decreased nutrient transfer efficiency. When phosphorus is extremely low, the plant increases mycorrhizal investment, but transfer efficiency may still be limited by the absolute scarcity of available nutrients.",
