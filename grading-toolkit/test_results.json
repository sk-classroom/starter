      "question": "In the original K\u00f6nigsberg bridge problem, why was it impossible to find a walk that crosses each bridge exactly once? Explain using the concept of node degrees.",
      "correct_answer": "It was impossible because all four landmasses (nodes) had an odd number of bridges (odd degree): North shore (3 bridges), South shore (3 bridges), Large island (5 bridges), and Small island (3 bridges). According to Euler's theorem, for an Euler path to exist, at most two nodes can have odd degree. Since all four nodes had odd degree, the desired walk was mathematically impossible.",
      "llm_answer": "In the original K\u00f6nigsberg bridge problem, a walk that crosses each bridge exactly once is impossible because all four landmasses have an odd degree. According to Euler's theorem, a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of such a walk is that all nodes have even degrees (except possibly the starting and ending points).\n\nIn the case of K\u00f6nigsberg, the degree of each node can be calculated as follows:\n\n* North shore: 3 bridges (node has an odd degree)\n* South shore: 3 bridges (node has an odd degree)\n* Large island: 5 bridges (node has an odd degree)\n* Small island: 3 bridges (node has an odd degree)\n\nSince each landmass has an odd number of edges, at least one node in each landmass has an odd degree. Therefore, the total sum of degrees is:\n\n4 (odd) + 4 (odd) = 8\n\nwhich is even. However, this alone does not guarantee that a walk exists.\n\nThe critical insight here is that when every node has an odd degree, it's impossible to find a path that enters and leaves each edge exactly once. This is because there will always be at least one \"wallflower\" edge (an edge connected to only one other edge) that cannot be paired up with another edge.\n\nIn the case of K\u00f6nigsberg, the two bridges connecting the large island to the small island are such wallflowers. The walk must start or end on one of these bridges, which means it can never cross both bridges exactly once.\n\nTherefore, according to Euler's theorem, since not all nodes have even degrees (specifically, the bridge between the large and small islands), a walk that crosses each bridge exactly once does not exist for the original K\u00f6nigsberg problem.",

The detailed breakdown of node degrees is also correct. While the student includes some extra reasoning about \"wallflower\" edges and a slightly convoluted explanation about the sum of degrees being even, these don't detract from the core understanding. The explanation is a bit verbose, but fundamentally correct and demonstrates a solid grasp of the problem and its solution.",

      "question": "Given an adjacency matrix A for an undirected graph, how would you compute the degree of each node? What mathematical property ensures that the sum of all degrees equals twice the number of edges?",
      "correct_answer": "The degree of each node is computed by summing the rows (or columns) of the adjacency matrix: degree[i] = sum(A[i,:]). The sum of all degrees equals twice the number of edges because each edge contributes 1 to the degree of both of its endpoints. If there are m edges, then sum of all degrees = 2m, since each edge is counted once for each of its two endpoints.",
      "llm_answer": "To compute the degree of each node in an undirected graph given an adjacency matrix `A`, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Row Sum**: For a row `i` in the matrix, the degree of node `i` is the sum of the elements at positions `(i, j)` where `j` ranges from `0` to `n-1` (where `n` is the number of nodes in the graph). This can be represented as:\n\n    ```python\ndef compute_degrees(row):\n    return sum(A[i][j] for i, j in enumerate(row))\n```\n\n2.  **Column Sum**: Alternatively, for a column `j`, the degree of node `j` is the sum of the elements at positions `(i, j)` where `i` ranges from `0` to `n-1`. This can be represented as:\n\n    ```python\ndef compute_degrees_col(j):\n    return sum(A[i][j] for i in range(len(A)))\n```\n\n3.  **Mathematical Property**: The mathematical property that ensures the sum of all degrees equals twice the number of edges is based on the observation that each edge contributes to the degree of two nodes.\n\n    For an undirected graph with `n` nodes and `m` edges, consider an arbitrary edge `(i, j)`. The degree of node `i` increases by 1, and the degree of node `j` also increases by 1. This results in a net increase of 2 to the total sum of degrees.\n\n    Mathematically, this can be represented as:\n\n    \\[ \\text{sum of degrees} = 2m \\]\n\nThis property is a direct consequence of the bipartite nature of an undirected graph's adjacency matrix and ensures that the sum of all node degrees accurately reflects the number of edges in the network.\n\nHere's some sample Python code to illustrate this:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef compute_degrees(A):\n    n = len(A)\n    degrees = []\n    \n    # Compute row sums (node degrees)\n    for i in range(n):\n        degree = sum(A[i, j] for j in range(n))\n        degrees.append(degree)\n        \n    return degrees\n\n# Example usage:\nA = np.array([[0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0]])\ndegrees = compute_degrees(A)\n\nprint(\"Node Degrees:\", degrees)\n\nn = len(degrees)\nm = np.count_nonzero(A) // 2\n\n# Check if sum of degrees equals twice the number of edges\nassert np.isclose(sum(degrees), 2 * m)\n```",
