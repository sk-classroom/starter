      "question": "According to Euler's Path Theorem, what are the necessary and sufficient conditions for a graph to have an Euler path (a walk that crosses every edge exactly once)?",
      "correct_answer": "A graph has an Euler path if and only if: (1) All nodes have even degree, OR (2) Exactly two nodes have odd degree. If all nodes have even degree, the path forms a cycle. If exactly two nodes have odd degree, the path must start at one odd-degree node and end at the other.",
      "llm_answer": "According to Euler's Path Theorem, a graph will have an Euler path if it satisfies two specific conditions:\n\n1. **Connectivity**: The graph must be connected, meaning there is a path between any pair of vertices in the graph.\n\n2. **Node Degrees**:\n   - Either all nodes (vertices) in the graph have even degrees.\n   - Or exactly two nodes have odd degrees. If this condition is met, the Euler path will start at one of these odd-degree nodes and end at the other.\n\nThese conditions are both necessary and sufficient for the existence of an Euler path within a graph. If both conditions are satisfied, it ensures that there exists a walk through the graph that crosses each edge exactly once.",

      "question": "In the original K\u00f6nigsberg bridge problem, why was it impossible to find a walk that crosses each bridge exactly once? Explain using the concept of node degrees.",
      "correct_answer": "It was impossible because all four landmasses (nodes) had an odd number of bridges (odd degree): North shore (3 bridges), South shore (3 bridges), Large island (5 bridges), and Small island (3 bridges). According to Euler's theorem, for an Euler path to exist, at most two nodes can have odd degree. Since all four nodes had odd degree, the desired walk was mathematically impossible.",
      "llm_answer": "In the original K\u00f6nigsberg bridge problem, it was impossible to find a walk that crosses each bridge exactly once due to the configuration of the node degrees. The city had four landmasses (nodes) connected by seven bridges (edges). Euler's insight into solving this problem involved examining the degree (the number of connections) of each node.\n\nEuler discovered that for such a path, known as an Eulerian path, to exist in an undirected graph, there must be either zero or exactly two nodes with an odd degree. An Eulerian circuit, which starts and ends at the same node, requires all nodes to have even degrees.\n\nIn K\u00f6nigsberg:\n\n- The north shore had 3 bridges (odd degree).\n- The south shore had 3 bridges (odd degree).\n- The large island had 5 bridges (odd degree).\n- The small island had 3 bridges (odd degree).\n\nAll four landmasses had an odd number of connections, meaning there were four nodes with odd degrees. According to Euler's theorem, this configuration does not satisfy the conditions for either an Eulerian path or circuit since it requires exactly zero or two nodes with odd degrees. Therefore, a walk crossing each bridge exactly once was mathematically impossible in K\u00f6nigsberg.",

      "question": "Given an adjacency matrix A for an undirected graph, how would you compute the degree of each node? What mathematical property ensures that the sum of all degrees equals twice the number of edges?",
      "correct_answer": "The degree of each node is computed by summing the rows (or columns) of the adjacency matrix: degree[i] = sum(A[i,:]). The sum of all degrees equals twice the number of edges because each edge contributes 1 to the degree of both of its endpoints. If there are m edges, then sum of all degrees = 2m, since each edge is counted once for each of its two endpoints.",
      "llm_answer": "To compute the degree of each node in an undirected graph represented by an adjacency matrix \\( A \\), you need to sum the entries in each row (or equivalently, each column, due to symmetry) of the matrix. The degree of a node is equal to the number of connections it has, which corresponds to the number of 1s in its respective row or column in the matrix.\n\nMathematically, for a graph with \\( n \\) nodes and adjacency matrix \\( A \\), where \\( A[i][j] = 1 \\) if there is an edge between node \\( i \\) and node \\( j \\), and \\( 0 \\) otherwise, the degree of node \\( i \\) can be computed as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{degree}(i) = \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} A[i][j]\n\\]\n\nThis operation should be performed for each node \\( i \\) from 0 to \\( n-1 \\).\n\nThe mathematical property that ensures the sum of all degrees equals twice the number of edges is known as the \"handshaking lemma.\" In an undirected graph, each edge contributes exactly 2 to the total degree count: one for each of its two endpoints. Therefore, if you sum the degrees of all nodes, each edge will be counted twice (once at each endpoint), leading to:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \\text{degree}(i) = 2 \\times (\\text{number of edges})\n\\]\n\nThis property holds true for any undirected graph and is fundamental in understanding the relationship between node degrees and edge count.",
